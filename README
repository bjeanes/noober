Setting up a machine for development involves a LOT of dependencies and time

* Developer Tools + iPhone SDK/XCode
* Homebrew
* Git
* Textmate + Bundles
* RVM + standard rubies + gems
* MacVIM + plugins
* Passenger
* Sequel Pro
* MySQL / Postgres
* Skype
* Firefox + extensions (firebug esp)
* Chrome + extensions
* ZSH
* Mailplane
* Adium
* Skitch
* MockSMTP
* GitX
* Growl
* SIMBL
* Set up iChat to have Bonjour (always on)
* Colemak / QWERTY / Dvorak / Backspace on capslock hack
* latest MacRuby
* Bind / DNSMasq
* LaunchBar
* Bash 4 (from homebrew?)
* Setup dot-files

MISC/hacks/prefs to set
* sudo ln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/sbin/airport
* turn universal access on (for applescripting interfaces, etc)

NOTES
* Use Sparkle RSS locations to get the latest version of each app for download so versions don't need to be maintained
* Standard way to apply licenses to everything?
